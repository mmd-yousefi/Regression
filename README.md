# Regression
This repository is a great resource for Python developers who are interested in implementing a regression model to predict house prices based on various features. 
The script is written in Python and makes use of popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and keras for data preprocessing, model training, and predictions.
The script is well-commented and easy to understand, making it a great starting point for developers who are new to machine learning and regression.
It is intended for educational and research purposes. The script also includes evaluation metric such as R-Square, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error to evaluate the performance of the model, which is a key aspect for data scientist and machine learning engineer. 
The data used in this script is not included, but can be easily obtained and preprocessed to use with this script.
