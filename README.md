# Regression
This repository is a great resource for Python developers who are interested in implementing a regression model to predict house prices based on various features. 
The script is written in Python and makes use of popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and keras for data preprocessing, model training, and predictions.
The script is well-commented and easy to understand, making it a great starting point for developers who are new to machine learning and regression.
It is intended for educational and research purposes. The script also includes evaluation metric such as Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error to evaluate the performance of the model, which is a key aspect for data scientists and machine learning engineers.
